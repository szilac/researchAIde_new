# ResearchAIde: Product Requirements Document

## Overview

ResearchAIde is an intelligent research assistant application that helps researchers identify novel and feasible research directions by analyzing scientific literature. The application addresses the critical challenge faced by researchers in navigating the overwhelming volume of published papers to discover unexplored research opportunities.

Researchers across academia and industry struggle with the time-consuming process of literature review, gap identification, and research ideation. This process typically requires weeks of reading papers, analyzing content, and collaborating with colleagues to identify promising research directions. ResearchAIde dramatically accelerates this process through AI-powered analysis and simulated academic collaboration.

The application targets several key user groups:
- Academic researchers (PhD students, postdocs, professors) seeking new research directions
- Industry R&D professionals looking to explore innovative approaches
- Interdisciplinary researchers navigating unfamiliar literature

ResearchAIde's value proposition is threefold:
1. **Time Efficiency**: Reduce the research planning process from weeks to hours
2. **Quality Enhancement**: Improve research direction quality through multi-agent collaboration and iterative refinement
3. **Knowledge Discovery**: Identify non-obvious connections and opportunities in scientific literature

By simulating the collaborative dynamics of academic research planning through specialized AI agents, ResearchAIde provides researchers with a powerful tool to accelerate innovation while maintaining human guidance and oversight.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Research Collaboration System

**What it does**: Employs specialized AI agents with distinct academic roles (PhD Student Agent and PostDoc Agent) that work together to analyze literature and refine research directions.

**Why it's important**: Single-agent systems lack the critical evaluation and refinement capabilities that emerge from academic collaboration. The multi-agent approach produces higher-quality research directions through specialized expertise and iterative feedback.

**How it works**: 
- The PhD Student Agent focuses on literature analysis, gap identification, and research direction generation
- The PostDoc Agent specializes in critical assessment, evaluating novelty and feasibility of proposed directions
- The agents engage in 2-3 rounds of proposal and feedback, refining directions iteratively
- An orchestrator module manages agent communication and workflow progression

### 2. Customizable LLM Integration

**What it does**: Allows users to select which Large Language Model(s) to use for powering the agents, with support for multiple providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic).

**Why it's important**: Different LLMs have varying strengths, cost structures, and availability. Giving users choice ensures flexibility, privacy options, and adaptation to evolving LLM capabilities.

**How it works**:
- User selects provider and model at session start
- System configures agents with selected models
- Optional: Different models can be assigned to different agent roles
- LLM API Manager abstracts provider differences behind unified interface

### 3. Arxiv Integration and Paper Processing Pipeline

**What it does**: Automatically searches Arxiv for relevant papers, retrieves metadata, downloads PDFs, extracts content, and transforms unstructured text into analyzable data.

**Why it's important**: Manual literature search and reading is the most time-consuming part of research planning. Automation of this process creates enormous time savings while ensuring comprehensive literature coverage.

**How it works**:
- PhD Agent formulates optimized Arxiv search queries from user input
- PhD Ahent retrieves paper metadata (title, authors, abstract, etc.) via tool call.
- PhD Agent analyzes abstracts to identify most relevant papers
- User reviews and modifies the shortlist
- System downloads PDFs of selected papers
- Multi-method text extraction processes PDFs (PyPDF2, PDFMiner)
- Content is structured, chunked, and prepared for vector storage

### 4. ChromaDB Vector Database Integration

**What it does**: Stores and indexes paper content in a local vector database (ChromaDB) to enable semantic search and analysis capabilities.

**Why it's important**: Vector search enables identification of conceptual relationships, gaps, and patterns that wouldn't be apparent through keyword search alone. Local storage enhances privacy and reduces dependency on external services.

**How it works**:
- Extracted text is chunked into optimal segments
- Embeddings are generated for each text chunk
- Chunks and embeddings are stored in ChromaDB collections
- PhD Agent performs semantic searches to identify research gaps via tool call.
- System analyzes result patterns to detect underexplored areas
- Vector similarities help assess novelty of proposed directions

### 5. Research Direction Identification and Assessment

**What it does**: Analyzes literature patterns to identify research gaps, generates potential research directions, and systematically assesses their novelty and feasibility.

**Why it's important**: Transforming literature analysis into concrete, actionable research directions with quality assessment is the core value of the application, providing researchers with a structured approach to research planning.

**How it works**:
- PhD Agent analyzes vector database to identify underexplored areas
- System generates 3-5 potential research directions with supporting evidence
- PostDoc Agent assesses novelty through comparison with existing literature
- PostDoc Agent evaluates feasibility considering technical requirements, resources, and challenges
- Each direction receives structured scores and detailed assessments
- Createing a novelity and feasibility matrix (e.g high novelity - high feasibility, high novelity - medium feasibility, etc.)
- System provides specific improvement suggestions for each direction

### 6. Iterative Refinement Process

**What it does**: Implements a multi-round refinement process where research directions are improved based on expert assessment and feedback.

**Why it's important**: Initial ideas rarely represent the best possible formulation. Iterative refinement mirrors academic collaboration processes and significantly improves the quality of research directions.

**How it works**:
- PhD Agent receives assessment and feedback from PostDoc Agent
- System analyzes feedback to identify improvement opportunities
- PhD Agent reformulates and enhances research directions
- Refined directions undergo reassessment
- Process repeats for 2-3 iterations or until minimal improvement is detected
- System tracks improvements across iterations for transparency

### 7. Comprehensive Research Report Generation

**What it does**: Creates a detailed, well-structured research report documenting the identified research directions, their assessment, and supporting evidence.

**Why it's important**: A comprehensive report provides researchers with actionable information they can directly use in research planning, grant applications, or team discussions.

**How it works**:
- System compiles all analysis and assessment information
- Report includes executive summary, introduction, literature overview, gap analysis, and detailed direction descriptions
- Each research direction includes title, description, supporting evidence, potential impact, challenges, and assessment scores
- Report is provided in both structured (JSON) and formatted (Markdown) versions
- Export options allow for easy sharing and reference

### C. ChromaDB Implementation Details

#### Setup and Configuration

```python
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings

# Configure ChromaDB with persistent storage
chroma_client = chromadb.Client(Settings(
    chroma_db_impl="duckdb+parquet",
    persist_directory="./data/chroma_db",
))
```

#### Collection Management

```python
def create_research_collection(session_id, research_area, research_topic):
    """Create a new collection for a research session."""
    # Create a collection name based on session and topic
    collection_name = f"research_{session_id}_{research_area.replace(' ', '_')}"
    
    # Create the collection with metadata about the research topic
    collection = chroma_client.create_collection(
        name=collection_name,
        metadata={
            "research_area": research_area,
            "research_topic": research_topic,
            "session_id": session_id,
            "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    )
    
    return collection
```

#### Embedding Generation

```python
def get_embedding_function(embedding_model="openai"):
    """Get the appropriate embedding function based on the selected model."""
    if embedding_model == "openai":
        from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import OpenAIEmbeddingFunction
        return OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(
            api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            model_name="text-embedding-ada-002"
        )
    elif embedding_model == "huggingface":
        from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import HuggingFaceEmbeddingFunction
        return HuggingFaceEmbeddingFunction(
            model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
        )
    else:
        # Default to SentenceTransformer for local embedding
        from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction
        return SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

#### Document Processing

```python
def process_document_for_storage(paper_id, paper_title, paper_text, chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200):
    """Process a document into chunks for storage in ChromaDB."""
    # Split the document into chunks
    chunks = []
    chunk_ids = []
    chunk_metadata = []
    
    # Simple chunking strategy (can be replaced with more sophisticated approaches)
    for i in range(0, len(paper_text), chunk_size - chunk_overlap):
        chunk = paper_text[i:i + chunk_size]
        if len(chunk) < 100:  # Skip very small chunks
            continue
            
        chunk_id = f"{paper_id}_chunk_{len(chunks)}"
        chunks.append(chunk)
        chunk_ids.append(chunk_id)
        chunk_metadata.append({
            "paper_id": paper_id,
            "paper_title": paper_title,
            "chunk_index": len(chunks) - 1,
            "chunk_size": len(chunk)
        })
    
    return chunks, chunk_ids, chunk_metadata
```

### D. PDF Extraction Technical Details

#### Multi-Method Extraction

```python
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    """
    Extract text from a PDF file using multiple methods for maximum text recovery.
    First tries PyPDF2, then PDFMiner, and optionally OCR for problematic sections.
    """
    # First attempt: Extract with PyPDF2
    text_by_page = _extract_with_pypdf(pdf_path)
    
    # Second attempt: For pages with little text, try PDFMiner
    for page_num, page_text in enumerate(text_by_page):
        if len(page_text.strip()) < 100:  # If page has little text
            pdfminer_text = _extract_with_pdfminer(pdf_path, page_num)
            if len(pdfminer_text.strip()) > len(page_text.strip()):
                text_by_page[page_num] = pdfminer_text
    
    # Third attempt: For still-problematic pages, use OCR if enabled
    if OCR_ENABLED:
        for page_num, page_text in enumerate(text_by_page):
            if len(page_text.strip()) < 100:  # Still little text
                ocr_text = _extract_with_ocr(pdf_path, page_num)
                if len(ocr_text.strip()) > len(page_text.strip()):
                    text_by_page[page_num] = ocr_text
    
    # Combine all page texts
    full_text = "\n\n".join(text_by_page)
    
    # Clean up the text
    clean_text = _clean_extracted_text(full_text)
    
    return clean_text
```

#### Document Structure Identification

```python
def extract_document_structure(text):
    """
    Extract document structure (sections, references) from text.
    
    Returns a dictionary with:
    - sections: List of section dictionaries with title and content
    - references: List of extracted references
    """
    # Extract sections based on common academic paper structure
    sections = _extract_sections(text)
    
    # Extract references
    references = _extract_references(text)
    
    return {
        "sections": sections,
        "references": references
    }
```
