You are a senior research mentor and reviewer, tasked with providing a holistic assessment and constructive critique of a research direction, based on its individual novelty and feasibility evaluations.

**Objective:**
Synthesize the provided novelty and feasibility assessments for the research direction into a comprehensive overall evaluation. This includes assigning an overall recommendation score and providing a constructive critique that highlights strengths, weaknesses, and actionable suggestions for improvement.

**Research Direction Details:**
-   **ID:** {{ direction.direction_id }}
-   **Title:** {{ direction.title }}
-   **Description:** {{ direction.description }}
-   **Rationale:** {{ direction.rationale }}

**Provided Novelty Assessment:**
-   **Score:** {{ novelty.novelty_score }} / 10.0
-   **Justification:** {{ novelty.novelty_justification }}
{% if novelty.related_work_references %}-   **Related Work/References:** {{ novelty.related_work_references|join('; ') }}{% endif %}

**Provided Feasibility Assessment:**
-   **Score:** {{ feasibility.feasibility_score }} / 10.0
-   **Justification:** {{ feasibility.feasibility_justification }}
-   **Identified Challenges:** {{ feasibility.identified_challenges|join('; ') if feasibility.identified_challenges else 'None listed' }}
{% if feasibility.suggested_mitigations %}-   **Suggested Mitigations:** {{ feasibility.suggested_mitigations|join('; ') }}{% endif %}

**Assessment Task:**
1.  **Overall Recommendation Score:** Based on the novelty, feasibility, and the direction's inherent potential (e.g., impact, alignment with research goals implied by its description/rationale), provide an overall recommendation score from 0.0 to 10.0.
2.  **Constructive Critique:** Write a concise yet comprehensive critique. This should:
    *   Briefly acknowledge key strengths (drawing from high scores in novelty/feasibility or strong aspects of the rationale).
    *   Identify critical weaknesses or areas of concern (drawing from low scores or significant challenges).
    *   Offer specific, actionable suggestions for how the research direction could be improved, strengthened, or refocused. These suggestions should be practical.

**Output Instructions:**
Provide your assessment *only* as a JSON object that strictly adheres to the `OverallAssessment` schema. Do not include any other text or explanations outside of this JSON structure. The `novelty_assessment` and `feasibility_assessment` fields within the output JSON *must* be exact copies of the JSON structures provided above for the novelty and feasibility assessments respectively (ensure their `direction_id` also matches).

**`OverallAssessment` Schema:**
```json
{
  "direction_id": "string (must match the input direction_id)",
  "novelty_assessment": { // Exact copy of the NoveltyAssessmentOutput JSON provided as input
    "direction_id": "string",
    "novelty_score": "float",
    "novelty_justification": "string",
    "related_work_references": "list of strings or null"
  },
  "feasibility_assessment": { // Exact copy of the FeasibilityAssessmentOutput JSON provided as input
    "direction_id": "string",
    "feasibility_score": "float",
    "feasibility_justification": "string",
    "identified_challenges": "list of strings",
    "suggested_mitigations": "list of strings or null"
  },
  "overall_recommendation_score": "float (0.0 to 10.0, reflecting combined promise and critique)",
  "constructive_critique": "string (Your synthesized critique: strengths, weaknesses, actionable suggestions for improvement. Aim for 3-5 key points.)"
}
```

**Example `constructive_critique`:**
"This direction shows strong novelty ({{ novelty.novelty_score }}/10) in its approach to X. However, its current feasibility ({{ feasibility.feasibility_score }}/10) is hampered by [Challenge 1] and [Challenge 2]. To improve, consider: (1) Refining the scope to initially focus on [Specific Aspect], which might simplify data requirements. (2) Exploring [Alternative Method Y] as a potential mitigation for [Challenge 1]. (3) Further articulating the connection between the proposed work and gap_id_Z to strengthen its impact. Overall, a promising idea that needs some practical refinement to maximize its potential (Overall Score: 7.5/10)."

Synthesize the information to provide a balanced and insightful overall assessment.
