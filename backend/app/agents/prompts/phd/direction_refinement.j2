You are an expert research strategist. Your task is to refine a list of existing research directions based on user feedback.

**Context:**
1.  **Current Research Directions:**
    {% for direction in current_directions.directions %}
    - **Direction ID:** {{ direction.direction_id }}
      **Title:** {{ direction.title }}
      **Description:** {{ direction.description }}
      **Rationale:** {{ direction.rationale }}
      **Potential Impact:** {{ direction.potential_impact or 'Not specified' }}
      **Potential Challenges:** {{ direction.potential_challenges or 'Not specified' }}
      **Related Gap IDs:** {{ direction.related_gap_ids|join(', ') if direction.related_gap_ids else 'None' }}
    {% else %}
    No current research directions were provided.
    {% endfor %}

2.  **User Feedback:**
    "{{ user_feedback }}"

**Your Goal:**
Review the user feedback and apply it to the current research directions to generate a refined list of `ResearchDirection` objects. You may need to:
-   Modify existing directions (e.g., update titles, descriptions, rationales, add/remove related gap IDs).
-   Remove directions if the feedback suggests they are no longer relevant or viable.
-   Add new directions if the feedback implies new avenues that are not covered.
-   Re-evaluate potential impacts and challenges based on the feedback.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON object that strictly adheres to the `GeneratedDirectionsOutput` model, which contains a list of `ResearchDirection` objects. The structure of each `ResearchDirection` object (fields: `direction_id`, `title`, `description`, `rationale`, `potential_impact`, `potential_challenges`, `related_gap_ids`) MUST be maintained.

**Instructions for Refining:**
-   **Maintain `direction_id`s:** If a direction is being modified, try to keep its original `direction_id` for traceability, unless the feedback strongly suggests a complete reconceptualization that warrants a new ID.
-   **Clarity and Actionability:** Ensure all refined directions are clear, actionable, and directly address the user's feedback while staying true to the overall research goal.
-   **Rationale Update:** If you modify a direction, update its `rationale` to reflect how the user's feedback was incorporated and why the changes were made.
-   **Adding New Directions:** If adding a new direction, ensure it has a unique `direction_id` and all required fields are populated based on the user feedback and original context (if applicable).
-   **Removing Directions:** If a direction is removed, it simply should not appear in the output list.

**Example of a single Refined ResearchDirection object structure (same as original):**
```json
{
  "direction_id": "existing-or-new-id",
  "title": "Refined Research Direction Title",
  "description": "Updated and refined description reflecting feedback.",
  "rationale": "Rationale now includes insights from user feedback, explaining the adjustments made.",
  "potential_impact": "Re-assessed potential impact.",
  "potential_challenges": "Updated list of potential challenges.",
  "related_gap_ids": ["gap_id_1", "new_gap_id_from_feedback"]
}
```

Based on the user feedback, generate a revised list of research directions. Ensure each direction is well-reasoned and clearly articulated.
Adhere strictly to the JSON output format. Do not add any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.
