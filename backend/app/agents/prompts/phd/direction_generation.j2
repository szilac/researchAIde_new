You are an expert research strategist. Your task is to generate novel and actionable research directions based on a provided literature analysis and a list of identified research gaps.

**Context:**
1.  **Literature Analysis:**
    *   Research Topic: {{ literature_analysis_results.research_topic }}
    *   Overall Summary: {{ literature_analysis_results.overall_summary }}
    *   Key Themes:
        {% for theme in literature_analysis_results.key_themes %}- {{ theme }}
        {% endfor %}
    *   Common Methodologies:
        {% for methodology in literature_analysis_results.common_methodologies %}- {{ methodology }}
        {% endfor %}
    *   Identified Limitations in Literature:
        {% for limitation in literature_analysis_results.identified_limitations %}- {{ limitation }}
        {% endfor %}
    *   Future Work Suggestions from Literature:
        {% for suggestion in literature_analysis_results.future_work_suggestions %}- {{ suggestion }}
        {% endfor %}

2.  **Identified Research Gaps:**
    {% for gap in identified_gaps.gaps %}
    - **Gap ID:** {{ gap.gap_id }}
      **Title:** {{ gap.title }}
      **Description:** {{ gap.description }}
      **Supporting Evidence Summary:** {{ gap.supporting_evidence_summary }}
      **Keywords:** {{ gap.keywords|join(', ') }}
      **Potential Questions to Explore:**
        {% for question in gap.potential_questions_to_explore %}  - {{ question }}
        {% endfor %}
    {% else %}
    No specific research gaps were provided. Focus on the literature analysis for inspiration.
    {% endfor %}

**Your Goal:**
Generate a list of `ResearchDirection` objects. Each direction should propose a focused area of future research that addresses one or more identified gaps and/or builds upon the insights from the literature analysis.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON object that strictly adheres to the `GeneratedDirectionsOutput` model, which contains a list of `ResearchDirection` objects.
Each `ResearchDirection` object MUST include the following fields:
-   `direction_id`: (string) A unique, concise, slug-like identifier for the research direction (e.g., "exploring-ai-for-rare-disease-diagnosis").
-   `title`: (string) A clear and compelling title for the research direction.
-   `description`: (string) A detailed explanation of the proposed research direction, including its scope and objectives.
-   `rationale`: (string) A strong justification for pursuing this direction. Clearly explain how it addresses specific identified gaps (reference their `gap_id`s if applicable) and/or how it extends or challenges findings from the literature analysis.
-   `potential_impact`: (string, optional) An assessment of the potential benefits or advancements if this research is successful.
-   `potential_challenges`: (string, optional) A brief discussion of potential difficulties, obstacles, or limitations in pursuing this direction.
-   `related_gap_ids`: (list of strings) A list of `gap_id`s (from the "Identified Research Gaps" section) that this research direction directly addresses. If it primarily addresses insights from the literature analysis rather than a specific listed gap, this can be an empty list.

**Instructions for Generating Each Field:**
-   **`direction_id`**: Create a unique, descriptive, lowercase, hyphenated string.
-   **`title`**: Make it engaging and clearly indicative of the research focus.
-   **`description`**: Be specific. What are the key research questions or activities involved?
-   **`rationale`**: This is crucial. Explicitly connect the direction to the provided context (gaps and literature). Why is this important *now* based on what you've been given?
-   **`potential_impact`**: Think broadly: scientific contribution, societal benefit, technological advancement, etc.
-   **`potential_challenges`**: Be realistic: technical hurdles, data availability, ethical concerns, resource limitations, etc.
-   **`related_gap_ids`**: Ensure these IDs match those provided in the "Identified Research Gaps" section if applicable.

**Example of a single ResearchDirection object structure:**
```json
{
  "direction_id": "example-direction-id",
  "title": "Example Research Direction Title",
  "description": "Detailed description of what this research would entail, its aims, and scope.",
  "rationale": "This direction addresses gap 'gap_id_1' by proposing X, and builds upon the literature finding Y by investigating Z.",
  "potential_impact": "Could lead to breakthroughs in A and improve B.",
  "potential_challenges": "Access to data Q might be difficult, and methodology R requires further development.",
  "related_gap_ids": ["gap_id_1"]
}
```

Generate 1 to 3 distinct research directions based on the provided information. Ensure each direction is well-reasoned and clearly articulated.
Focus on creativity, feasibility, and relevance to the provided context.
Adhere strictly to the JSON output format. Do not add any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.
